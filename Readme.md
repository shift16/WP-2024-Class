Q: What your computer experience has been so far. Include any interesting projects that you've worked on or interesting courses you've taken.

I have been messing with computers for over a decade now and been programming for a decent amount of time so I'm pretty knowledgeable about computers. But, as you know, the computer science field is extremely large so there's much to learn. Anyway, an interesting class I had last semester was Combinatorics. Combinatorics is a field of mathematics that focuses on counting problems and analyzing properties of discrete structures like graphs. I found it interesting because it was something new for me to learn and it re-sparked my interest in mathematics for being a class that focused less on formulas and more on logic.

Q: Where do you see yourself using what you learn in this course?

Right now, I'm working on multiple projects under Dr. Richardson which require me to work with web technologies to create fully functioning webpages so taking this class will directly improve my ability to do that.
